# üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥ Popmenu Interview Project

This repository contains the implementation of the Popmenu Interview Project, a RESTful API for managing restaurant menus and menu items. The project is built with **Ruby on Rails**, uses **PostgreSQL** as the database, and is containerized with **Docker** using **docker-compose**. Tests are written with **RSpec** and use **FactoryBot** and **Faker** for test data.

Features

Level 1: Basic menu system with Menu and MenuItem models, RESTful endpoints, and validations.

Level 2: Adds Restaurant model, many-to-many relationship between Menu and MenuItem, and nested routes.

Level 3: Implements JSON import endpoint (POST /api/import) to process restaurant data, with detailed logging and error handling.
